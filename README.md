This project is a facial recognition system developed in Java using the OpenCV library via a Java wrapper. It was created to demonstrate the ability to integrate powerful computer vision capabilities into Java applications, such as facial detection and recognition.

Technologies Used
Java: The core programming language for the project.
OpenCV: Open-source computer vision and machine learning software library, used for facial detection and recognition.
OpenCV Java Wrapper: Provides easy integration of OpenCV's functionalities into Java projects.

Features
Facial Detection: Detects faces in real-time from input sources such as images, videos, or live streams (camera).
Facial Recognition: Matches detected faces against a dataset to recognize known faces.
OpenCV Integration: The project leverages the robust OpenCV library to perform the heavy lifting in image processing and facial detection.
